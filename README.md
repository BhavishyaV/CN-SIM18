# CN-SIM18
The aim of this project is to integrate the Crypto++ library into the latest version of ns-3.
Crypto++ (or cryptopp) is a popular C++ library that contains the implementation of all
well known cryptography algorithms. ns-3 is also developed using C++ and permits the user
to link other C++ libraries to it. In this project, the main aim is to link Crypto++ library in ns-3
and showcase its use-cases by leveraging the implementation of Cryptographic algorithms in
Crypto++.
